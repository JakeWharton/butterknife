Butter Knife
============

![Logo](website/static/logo.png)

Field and method binding for Android views which uses annotation processing to generate boilerplate
code for you.

 * Eliminate `findViewById` calls by using `@InjectView` on fields.
 * Group multiple views in a list using `@InjectViews`. Operate on all of them at once with actions,
   setters, or properties.
 * Eliminate anonymous inner-classes for listeners by annotating methods with `@OnClick` and others.

```java
class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @InjectView(R.id.user) EditText username;
  @InjectView(R.id.pass) EditText password;

  @OnClick(R.id.submit) void submit() {
    // TODO call server...
  }

  @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.simple_activity);
    ButterKnife.bind(this);
    // TODO Use fields...
  }
}
```

__Remember: A butter knife is like [a dagger][1] only infinitely less sharp.__
